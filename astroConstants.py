 Notes for upgrading this function:
     It is possible to add new constants.
     - DO NOT change the structure of the function, as well as its
         prototype.
     - DO NOT change the identifiers of the constants that have already
         been defined in this function. If you want to add a new
         constant, use an unused identifier.
     - DO NOT add constants that can be easily computed starting form
         other ones (avoid redundancy).
     Contact the author for modifications.
